# FlashCards Fun Study Tool

## Project Overview

   I was given three and a half days to build an application that can run through the command line interaface (CLI). This application would contain a set of "flashcards"  each with a question the user should answer. After each guess, the user should receive feedback on their guess ("Correct!" or "Incorrect!"). Once a guess has been inputed for each flashcard, the study round is over and the user should receive feedback with the percentage of correct answers. These features should make use of five classes, which built on each other like so: Card > Deck > Turn > Round > Game. A test suite had to be created for each of those classes, but the first one (the Card Class). 


## Learning Goals

  For me, the project's main goal was aimed at creating a robust testing suite using TDD. Other goals were continue to increase familiarity with: ES6 classes, building modular, reusable code by following SRP, and other good developer practices.
 
 
### Wins

  - I built a project board, and used it to lay the framework to this study tool.
  - I focused on developing good TDD practices, by building a number of test before writing any code. 
  - I explored different types of assertions, and how they may be subtly asking for different things.
  - Overall, even though I was not able to deliver a finished study tool, I feel I developed a solid foundation on writing tests and using TDD. 
  - I'm still genuinely excited to receive feedback.
  
### Challenges 

  - So many assertion possibilities!!!! Finding which would check what I wanted, how I wanted it, was challenging.
  - Similarly, being explicit of what I wanted to create. Where as before I created projects in a gradual organic process where data almost shaped itself according to my skills, I now had to make that process explicit. 
  - For this module, I chose to be an SAB, a leadership role amongst cohort members, which comes with added responsibilities that take time. It made me realize that my time management is lacking the structure to effectively manage the work load. A win for another time...     
  - In a nutshell, learning is tough... but I enjoyed exploring a new tool set.
